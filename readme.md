simply-oauth
===========
This is an update to `node-oauth` to modernize the API with async functions.

A simple oauth API for Node.js .  This API allows users to authenticate against OAUTH providers, and thus act as OAuth consumers. It also has support for OAuth Echo, which is used for communicating with 3rd party media providers such as TwitPic and yFrog.

Tested against Twitter (http://twitter.com), term.ie (http://term.ie/oauth/example/), TwitPic, and Yahoo!

Also provides rudimentary OAuth2 support, tested against facebook, github, foursquare, google and Janrain.   For more complete usage examples please take a look at connect-auth (http://github.com/ciaranj/connect-auth)
